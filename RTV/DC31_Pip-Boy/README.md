<details>
<summary>Badge Menu</summary>

The badge has five options in the menu: Game, WiFi, Settings, About, and Party. You must use the scroll wheel in the top right corner to navigate the menu. To select an option, press the scroll wheel in.

Game - I will go over that below.

WiFi - This doesn't appear to be working after the firmware refresh (which I was at DEFCON)

Settings - This allows you to reset the badge by holding the "A" button

About - Credits Page from the builder

Party - Flash colors and the Red Team Village log moves across the screen. To exit out of this, hit either "A" or "B". You can aswell reboot the Badge via the Power Switch.
